# Trap Sensor

Trap Sensor is a grid-based puzzle game where players must reveal all safe cells while avoiding hidden traps. The game features configurable difficulty levels, a clean UI with status tracking, and classic Minesweeper mechanics.

## Implementations

This project has two implementations:

* Complete (with flood-fill, configurable complexity) at [./trapsensor](./trapsensor)
* Simplified (less flexible, shorter code, for educational purposes) at [./trapsensor_simple](./trapsensor_simple)

## Framework

Games are built for [LÖVE framework](https://love2d.org) and are supposed to be run in context of [project Compy](https://github.com/compy-toys/compy).
